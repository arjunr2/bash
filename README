# WALI Bash

Basic readme on bash can be found in upstream fork

## Compiling for WALI

Run the script `./conf_command.sh`. Make sure to change the WALI sysroot directory as well as the LLVM compiler-rt
library for wasm32


## Notes

Compile `lib/sh/mbschr.c` independently by fixing the makefile since it is required for bash 
Link TERMCAP independently in parent makefile
